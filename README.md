With rapid urbanization, retrieving livability information of human settlements in time is essential for urban planning and governance. However, livability assessment is often limited by data availability and their update cycle, and this problem is more serious when making assessment at finer spatial scales (e.g., community level). We develop a reliable and dynamic model for community-level livability assessment, which provides detailed and useful information of human settlements for sustainable urban planning and governance. Here we present the code for the main procedures of data processing described in the Methods section in our manuscript (Zhu et al., 2020. Remote Sensing, Under Review).
